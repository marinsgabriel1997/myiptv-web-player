# IPTV Player

This is a simple web-based IPTV player that allows you to stream live TV channels from M3U/M3U8 playlists. The player is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it supports HLS streaming via the `hls.js` library. The project is hosted on GitHub Pages, making it easy to access and use directly from your browser.

## Features

- **Load M3U/M3U8 Playlists**: You can load playlists by providing a URL or uploading a local M3U/M3U8 file.
- **Channel List**: Displays a list of channels from the loaded playlist, including channel logos and names.
- **Online/Offline Status**: The player checks the online status of each channel and displays an indicator (✅ for online, ❌ for offline).
- **Search Functionality**: You can search for specific channels by name.
- **Responsive Design**: The player is designed to work on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Dark Theme**: The interface features a dark theme for better viewing experience.

## How to Use

1. **Load a Playlist**:
   - Enter the URL of an M3U/M3U8 playlist in the input field on the left sidebar.
   - Alternatively, upload a local M3U/M3U8 file.
   - Click the "Adicionar Lista" (Add Playlist) button to load the playlist.

2. **View Channels**:
   - Once the playlist is loaded, the channels will appear in the right sidebar.
   - The player will automatically check the online status of each channel and display an indicator.

3. **Play a Channel**:
   - Click on a channel in the list to start streaming.
   - The video player will load the channel, and you can control playback using the video controls.

4. **Search for Channels**:
   - Use the search bar in the right sidebar to filter channels by name.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the structure of the web page.
- **CSS3**: For styling and layout, including a dark theme and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: For handling playlist loading, channel filtering, and video playback.
- **hls.js**: A JavaScript library that enables HLS streaming in browsers that do not natively support it.
